    "description": "The DGA analyzer uses a logistic regression model to identify domain names that are suspected to have been generated by malware using a domain generation algorithm (DGA).  Logistic regression is a supervised machine learning model that was trained on thousands of examples of both known good and known bad domain names.  Domains with DGA scores closer to 1 are more likely to have been generated automatically.",
