    "description": "Connection Count tracks the number of unique destination IP addresses connected to by each source IP.  This analyzer uses a specialized data structure called the HyperLogLog to efficiently store the distinct IP addresses.  HyperLogLog is a type of “sketch” algorithm which uses probabilistic hashing to minimize the space required to store large sets.",
